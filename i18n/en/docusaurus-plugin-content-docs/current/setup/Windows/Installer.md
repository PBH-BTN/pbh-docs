# Installer

## Download and Installation

Open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper/releases/latest). You will find three installers ending with `.exe`.

Among them, one has a `nojava` tag, and the other does not. If you are unfamiliar with what Java is, please choose the download **without** the nojava tag.

Then, you will also notice the difference between `x64` and `arm64`:
* For most users, please download the `.exe` installer with the `x64` tag.
* If you are an unfortunate user who has purchased a Windows notebook with a Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU: please download the `.exe` installer with the `arm64` tag.

### Boot Startup

When you check the box to start with the system, PBH will silently start to the system tray when you log in to the Windows desktop.

## GUI/GUI Silent/NoGUI

### GUI

As the name suggests, PeerBanHelper starts with a graphical window. There will be a window to view logs, and a menu to open the data folder and log in to the WebUI without logging in.
Clicking the close button on the window will minimize it to the system tray icon.

### GUI Silent

Similar to GUI, but the window will not be displayed when starting. Suitable for users who like silent startup.

### NoGUI

In the console mode situation, it is the most resource-saving. Suitable for pro users.
